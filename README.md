MediaPlayerClassic
==================

A code base of the original media player classic 6.4.9.0 from 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli/files/Media%20Player%20Classic/ 
and 6.4.9.1 from 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli2/. 
I dont like mpc-hc and mpc-be, so I may take this code base and implement my own version or just mess around with it a bit. 
I like the idea of a single file no dependency media player. 
This will also serve as a repository for this old code and executables.

The original 6.4.9.0 version is under th GNU license (included in branch with source code)
so is 6.4.9.1

There are two branches for the original source bases from SourceForge
